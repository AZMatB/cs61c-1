How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb?
use run command in following way
run arg1 arg2 ... argn

How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (eg when certain variables are a certain value)?
you can use a conditional break statement

How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after a break?
you can use step

If the next line is a function call, you'll execute the call in one step. How do you execute the C code, line by line, inside the function call?
you can specify which function you want to add breakpoint to 
break function
USE next
upon reaching a function call next will put you to the next line skipping what happens in function 

USE step instead.

How do you continue running the program after breaking?
continue

show env => all variables within enviroment

How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
set watch point
watch variable_name
