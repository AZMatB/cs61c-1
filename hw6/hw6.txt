Problem 3
I would make RegWr = 0 by default.  The input of an instruction would send a signal to change RegWr =1 if needed.  Then one would have two cases:

case 1:
$c != 0 than no-op.  Therefore, RegWr ==0 by default, signal would be 0.  Therefore, nothing will be written to from the register and nothing happens

case 2:
$c == 0 then the signal to RegWr =1; therefore, the value of $b will get copied to $a.
